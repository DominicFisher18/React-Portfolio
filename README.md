## Description ##

The goal of this assignment is to create a portfolio using react, which is a good way to set yourself apart since displaying proficiency in react is very appealing to potential employers.  I have not finished the portfolio yet, but i have created the necessary files and have completed my nav bar.  I plan to finish the portfolio and fully customize it when i have time.
